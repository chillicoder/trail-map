Validation
----------

You know everyday Objective-C and iOS development when you can:

* Use Xcode (and the built-in Interface Builder) to compile an iOS app.
* Describe and use ARC and MRC for memory mangement, as well as the rules of the retain/release cycle.
* Use the basic data types (NSInteger, NSString), collection objects (NSArray, NSDictionary), and know when to use them instead of C primitives (int, char, etc).
* Use the basic display and navigation elements (UIWindow, UIView, UINavigationBar, UIToolbar, etc).
* Implement the various iOS controls (UISwitch, UILabel, UISegmentedControl, etc).
* Design and use basic design patterns like MVC, delegates, callbacks, and notifications.
* Use CoreLocation to get location coordinates.
* Implement network communications using AFNetworking, ASI, or NSUrlConnection.
* Implement UX and design best practices as prescribed by Apple.
* Meet App Store submission requirements and submit an app.

You know advanced Objective-C & iOS Development when you can:

* Create and manage Core Data objects and schemas.
* Decide when to best use:
    * A category vs subclassing.
    * Singletons.
    * Delegates.
    * Proxies.
* Implement animations using CoreAnimation and optimize drawing using CoreGraphics.
* Implement a multi-tasking environment free of race conditions (using appropriate locking techniques such as mutexes and semaphores, message passing, etc).
* Debug memory leaks using NSZombieEnabled, Instruments, and other tools.

Ongoing reference
-----------------

* Maintain an active ADC account and refer to [the official documentation](https://developer.apple.com).
* Keep up-to-date on iOS news.
